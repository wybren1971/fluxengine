Disk: Micropolis
================

Micropolis MetaFloppy disks use MFM and hard sectors. They were 100 TPI and
stored 315k per side. Each of the 16 sectors contains 266 bytes of "user data,"
allowing 10 bytes of metadata for use by the operating system. Micropolis DOS
(MDOS) used the metadata bytes, but CP/M did not.

Some later systems were Micropolis-compatible and so were also 100 TPI, like
the Vector Graphic Dual-Mode Disk Controller which was paired with a Tandon
drive.

**Important note:** You _cannot_ read these disks with a normal PC drive, as
these drives are 96tpi.The track spacing is determined by the physical geometry
of the drive and can't be changed in software. You'll need to get hold of a
100tpi Micropolis drive. Luckily these seem to use the same connector and
pinout as a 96tpi PC 5.25" drive. In use they should be identical.

Reading disks
-------------

Just do:

```
fluxengine read micropolis
```

You should end up with a `micropolis.img` which is 630784 bytes long (for a
normal DD disk). The image is written in CHS order, but HCS is generally used
by CP/M tools so the image needs to be post-processed. For only half-full disks
or single-sided disks, you can use `--heads 0` to read only one side of the
disk which works around the problem.

The [CP/M BIOS](https://www.seasip.info/Cpm/bios.html) defined SELDSK, SETTRK,
and SETSEC, but no function to select the head/side. Double-sided floppies
could be represented as having either twice the number of sectors, for CHS, or
twice the number of tracks, HCS; the second side's tracks logically followed
the first side (e.g., tracks 77-153). Micropolis disks tended to be the latter.
